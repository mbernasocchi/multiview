**Installation:
- PyQT4.Qwt5 (http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net) is needed for timeplot
- PyQglViewer (http://hub.qgis.org/documents/1) is needed for helix view

**New Visualizations:
- To implement a new visualization create a new widget like the others.
- Use rawvaluewidget.py as example, all methods implemented there are required
- Finally instantiate it in MultiViewWidget.__init__
- all visualization widgets recive the data as the rawvalue data widget shows
